# BASIC-APT
Install packages and sources from command-line

# add repo at repo.realmcode.com
install BASIC-APT
install NewTerm 2

# invoking program

this works from ssh and on local NewTerm 2

to start `run:`
```
su
alpine
basicapt
```
With this tweak it gives the never seen before option:
1. add sources from ssh when your i-device is frozen or is in respring mode
2. it allows for you to list packages and install without using wget from terminal
3. Its all open-source
